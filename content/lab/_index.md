I am often looking for research assistants and PhD students to collaborate on ongoing research projects.

If you are a prospective PhD student interested in working with me – I do not admit candidates to our department individually. You should apply to the MORS PhD program in the “Macro” track and signal your interest in working with me.

If you are a master’s or undergraduate student looking for RA opportunities, feel free to reach out. Please include detailed information about the following:    

- the areas I am working on that you are most interested in
- your quantitative skills (tell me about a previous project in which you applied these skills)
- your availability (which period, days, etc.)

I look forward to hearing from you!
