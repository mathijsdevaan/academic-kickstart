Mathijs' lab is often looking for research assistants and PhD students to collaborate on ongoing research projects.

If you are a prospective PhD student interested in working with Mathijs, please apply directly to the MORS PhD program in the “Macro” track and signal your interest in working with him.

If you are a master’s or undergraduate student looking for RA opportunities, feel free to reach out. Please include detailed information about the following:    

- the areas Mathijs is working in that you are most interested in
- your quantitative skills (tell us about a previous project in which you applied these skills)
- your availability (which period, days, etc.)

We look forward to hearing from you!
