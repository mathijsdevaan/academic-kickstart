I am an Assistant Professor of Business Administration at the Haas School of Business at the University of California Berkeley. My research interests include social networks, medical sociology and the sociology of science. I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Sociology at Columbia University. 

In my research I examine processes of social influence and how they shift people's behaviors and beliefs. Most of my current research examines social influence processes in contexts of health care and science..
