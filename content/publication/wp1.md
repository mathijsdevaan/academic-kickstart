#abstract = "We propose a generalized focal loss function based on the Tversky index to address the issue of data imbalance in medical image segmentation. Compared to the commonly used Dice loss, our loss function achieves a better trade off between precision and recall when training on small structures such as lesions. To evaluate our loss function, we improve the attention U-Net model by incorporating an image pyramid to preserve contextual features. We experiment on the BUS 2017 dataset and ISIC 2018 dataset where lesions occupy 4.84% and 21.4% of the images area and improve segmentation accuracy when compared to the standard U-Net by 25.7% and 3.6%, respectively."

abstract = "Third parties that refer clients to providers help clients navigate market uncertainty by: (i.) curating well-tailored matches between clients and experts, and (ii.) facilitating post-match trust. We argue that these two roles often conflict with one another because they require referrers to activate network relationships with different experts. While strong ties between referrers and experts promote trust between clients and experts, such ties reduce the likelihood that intermediaries consider referrals to more distal experts that are be better suited to serve a clientâ€™s needs. We examine this unexplored tension using full population medical claims data for the state of Massachusetts. We find that when primary care physicians (PCPs) refer patients to specialists with whom the PCP has a strong tie, patients demonstrate more confidence in the recommendations of the specialist. However, a strong tie between the PCP and specialist also reduces the expertise match between a patient's diagnosis and a specialist's clinical experience. These findings suggest that the two central means by which referrers add value may be at odds with one another because they are maximized by activation of different network relationships."
